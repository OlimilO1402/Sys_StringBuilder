Project started around mid 2005  

ReadMe.txt of 2005 under WindowsXP:
StringBuilderBench what is it?
This is a benchmark program which tests the speed of different 
implementaionts of the class StringBuilder in VBC
you can find many at least two different ones: 
* Jost Schwider's Concat
* Steve McMahon's StringBuilder
Though using MidB is definitely faster than using RtlMoveMemory.  
But Jost Schwiders algorithm has one obvious catch in it.
So the speed could be increased about the factor 7 just by 
using a faster string allocation method.

```vba
Property Get Value()
End Property
```
